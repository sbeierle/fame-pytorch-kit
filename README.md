## üöÄ About

This project provides a complete and clean build kit for compiling a working PyTorch ROCm version on AMD GPUs ‚Äì  
without the usual headaches involving ROCm, HIP, OpenMP, or Git submodules.

You will find everything needed to build, install, and test PyTorch from source, generating a valid `.whl` package for your local machine.
